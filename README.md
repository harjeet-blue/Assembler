# Assembler
This is Assembler , it converts assembly code in binary code according to its ISA ( Instruction Set Architecture )

IT ALSO DETECTS THE SYNTAX ERROR IN THE ASSEMBLY CODE OF THE INPUT FILE
***********************************************************************************************************************************
Discription of this assembler's ISA is given in complete detail in the problem statement pdf eg. syntax of the assembley code which 
this assembler accepts , opcode of the insructions etc.
***********************************************************************************************************************************
There is a sample test case file given for reference. You can take a look and can see how the assembly code file looks like for this assembler.
Moreover, there's an output file for the same test case, which has the binary code for the given assembly code.
